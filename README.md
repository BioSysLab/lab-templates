# Lab Templates

Here you can find useful templates that previous or current members of the lab have created and used in their projects/theses/presentations.

## How to use the .tex and .bib files

A .tex file usually opens with a GUI application like TexMaker or TexStudio (I use TexMaker but feel free to explore), and needs a MikTex distribution installed on your laptop to compile.
A .bib file works along with the .tex file and provides the references and bibliography to the main .tex file. You should work on the two files parallel, updating them accordingly.
